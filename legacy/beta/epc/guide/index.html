                    <h1g>About the Eternal Power Calculator</h1g>

                    You will gain a competitive edge in <b>Eternal</b> by maximizing the chances of playing your cards on curve. <br>
                    <br>Getting under the hood and optimizing your deck's power base is
                    the best way to ensure that you can play the cards you want, when you
                    want to play them. <br>
                    <br>
                    The <b>Eternal Power Calculator</b> is a deck-building tool that
                    visualizes your odds of drawing enough<b> Influence</b> and <b>Power</b>
                    based specifically on the cards found in your deck.

                    <h1g>How it works</h1g>

                    Import a deck and the visualizer will display a graph showing the
                    probability of meeting specific <strong>Influence</strong>
                    requirements over a set number of turns. The first column represents
                    your opening hand when going first.

                    <h1g><a name="chart" id="chart"></a>Charting

                    <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJ.png" margin-bottom="0" margin-left="50o" width="800"></center>

                    <pg>
                    In this example you can see that on Turn 2 you have a better than
                    90% chance of drawing the right <b>Influence</b> to play any card
                    with a cost of <img  src="../icon-justice.png" alt="Justice" title="Justice" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;">, namely <em><b>Vanquish</b></em>.
                    Follow the curve to see that your chances only increase with each
                    additional draw. <h2g>But what if you want to play <strong><em>Valkyrie
                          Enforcer</em></strong> on <strong>Turn 3</strong>?</h2g> </pg>
                  <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJJ.png" margin-bottom="0" width="800"></center>
                  <pg><br>

                    is a higher Influence cost, so your chances decrease. <br>
                    <br>
                    Fortunately this deck builder (2017 ETS World Champion camat0) has
                    included enough <strong>Justice</strong> sources in his power base
                    that the odds are still pretty good - nearly 80%.
                    <h1g><a name="draws" id="draws"></a>Draws vs. Turns</h1g>
                    Here the chart tells us that after 7 turns our odds of hitting <img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"><img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire" title="Fire" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"> to
                    play <em>Icaria, the Liberator</em> are potentially as low as 70%.</pg>
                  <center><img src="../guide/images/ExampleJJJFFF.png" width="800"></center>
                  <pg> However - assuming you will play at least one aditional draw card such as <strong>Quarry</strong> before Turn 7 - your
                    chances of meeting Icaria’s steep <img src="../icon-fire.png" alt="Fire"

                    requirements improve, as represented by columns 8 or 9. <br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond the first turn, most decks include additional card draw. Even
                    though we might speak of wanting to play <em><strong>Harsh Rule</strong></em>
                    “on Turn 4 or 5,” what we are really saying is “4 or 5 draws beyond our
                    opening hand.” <br>
                    <br>
                    This becomes even more important as the game goes on. You draw at
                    least one card per turn of course. But ideally you will also draw some
                    extra cards along the way.<br>
                    <br>
                    When using the <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong>, it helps to
                    get in the habit of thinking of number of draws rather than number of
                    turns. <h1g><a name="table" id="table"></a>Power Odds Table</h1g>
                    <strong>Influence</strong> is only one of two costs in Eternal that are associated with
                    playing your cards. To see the whole picture, we must also consider <strong>
                      Power.</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    For simplicity, we generally assume that at least one <strong>Power</strong>
                    card will be drawn for each turn, and our <strong>Maximum Power</strong>
                    will increase at a consistent rate. <br>
                    <br>
                    Realistically, however - that only happens when luck is on our side.
                    It is often just as true that we will miss a <strong>Power</strong>
                    drop and not be able to play <em><strong>Sandstorm Titan </strong></em>until
                    Turn 5 or later. <br>
                    <br>
                    Deck-builders are constantly asking themselves questions such as,
                    “Have I included enough power to reliably cast <em><strong>Channel
                        the Tempest</strong></em> when I want to?” <br>
                    <br>
                    The <strong>Power Odds Table</strong> removes the guesswork by
                    factoring in both <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong>
                    costs for every card in your deck. This includes neutral cards such
                    as <em><strong>Seek Power </strong></em>or the <em><strong>Strangers</strong></em>.
                    It even accounts for <strong>Ultimates</strong>, Champion thresholds and other abilities
                    that have a cost associated with them.&nbsp; </pg>
                  <center><img src="../guide/images/OddsTable.jpeg" width="800"></center>
                  <pg> <h1g><a name="not" id="not"></a>What is <em>not</em> accounted
                      for?</h1g> The probabilities displayed by the <strong>Eternal Power
                      Calculator</strong> are quite accurate and will help you gain a
                    better understanding of your deck. But for the sake of simplification,
                    a couple of factors are not accounted for mathematically: mulligans
                    and prerequisites. <br>
                    <br>
                    These two factors influence the probabilities in different ways, and
                    when combined they come close to balancing each other out - so the net
                    result is minimal.
                    <br><br>

                    <!-- <h2g>The Mulligan Phase</h2g> Deciding whether or
                    not to keep your opening hand is a strategic decision in <strong>Eternal</strong>.
                    If you choose to re-draw, your starting hand is guaranteed to include
                    either 2, 3 or 4 power cards (with an equal chance of each). <br>
                    <br>
                    This raises your chances of having more <strong>Influence</strong> to
                    start with - so (generally speaking) your odds may be ever-so-slightly
                    higher than what is actually depicted on the charts in the <strong>Eternal
                      Power Calculator</strong>. <h2g>Pre-requisites</h2g> On the other
                    hand, some power sources have a <strong>Power </strong>cost
                    associated with them. <em><strong>Seek Power </strong></em>and the
                    five <em><strong>Favors</strong></em> are the most obvious examples.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong> considers any card that
                    increases your <strong> Power</strong> to be a <strong>Power</strong>
                    source when determining probabilities. But it does not consider the
                    sequence in which cards are played.<br>
                    <br>
                    In other words, including <em><strong>Vara's Favor</strong></em> in
                    your deck will increase the overall chances of reaching your desired<strong>
                      Shadow Influence</strong> costs. But because it can not be played
                    until Turn 2,&nbsp; if you draw <em><strong>Vara's Favor </strong></em><strong></strong>instead
                    of a <strong>Power </strong>card your true odds of achieving <img src="../icon-shadow.png"

                      alt="Shadow" title="Shadow" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"> on <strong>Turn
                      1</strong> will be ever-so-slightly lower than what is represented
                    on the charts. -->

                        <h1g>Power Calculator Math</h1g>

                        <p>
                        You may be wondering how the power calculator computes
                        probabilities.  In order to understand the math,
                        we need to discuss
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">
                        binomial coefficients</a> and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution">
                        hypergeometric distributions</a>.

                        <p>
                        A binomial coeffient (sometimes referred to as
                        "`n` choose `k`") is a way of computing the number of
                        ways to select a subset of items from a larger
                        collection.  In the context of a card game, we can
                        use it to compute the number of different `n` card
                        hands drawn from a `N` card deck.

                        <p>
                        `
                        ((N),(n)) = (N!)/(n!(N-n)!)
                        `

                        <p>
                        `N =` Cards in deck
                        <br>
                        `n =` Number of cards drawn

                        <p>
                        While `((N),(n))` will give us the number of different
                        hands possible to draw, it doesn't directly give us any
                        probabilities.  However, we can get the
                        probability of drawing exactly `k` power cards from a
                        deck containing `K` power cards (of `N` cards total)
                        by dividing the number of possible hands containing
                        `k` power cards by the number of total possible hands.
                        This is referred to as a hypergeometric
                        distribution.

                        <p>
                        `
                        P(k) =
                          (((K),(k))((N-K),(n-k))) /
                          (((N),(n)))
                        `

                        So, that's useful.  `P(k)` will give us the probability
                        of drawing a hand of exactly `k` power cards.  However,
                        we usually care about the probability of drawing
                        <em>at least</em> `k` power cards, rather than the
                        probability of drawing exactly `k` power cards.  We
                        can find the probability of drawing at least
                        `k` power by adding up the probability values for
                        every value of `k`, up to the maximum number of power
                        cards.

                        <p>
                        `P(k >= T) = sum_(i=T)^(K) P(i)`

                        <p>
                        `K = ` Power cards in deck
                        <br>
                        `k = ` Power cards drawn
                        <br>
                        `T = ` Target power cards
                        <br>
                        `n = ` Total cards drawn

                        <p>
                        Okay, so now we know how to compute the probability
                        of drawing enough power.  But what if we care about
                        multiple kinds of influence?  As it turns out, we can
                        generalize the hypergeometric distribution to compute
                        probabilities when we care about multiple different
                        card types drawn.  For example, fire influence drawn
                        and time influence drawn.

                        <p>
                        `
                        P(k_F,k_T) =
                          (((K_F),(k_F))
                          ((K_T),(k_T))
                          ((N-K_F-K_T),
                            (n-k_F-k_T)))
                          /
                          (((N),(n)))
                        `

                        <p>
                        `K_F =` Fire influence cards in deck
                        <br>
                        `K_T =` Time influence cards in deck
                        <br>
                        `k_F =` Fire influence cards drawn
                        <br>
                        `k_T =` Time influence cards drawn
                        <br>
                        `N =` Total cards in deck
                        <br>
                        `n =` Total cards drawn

                        <p>
                        Again, this will give us the probability
                        `P(k_F, k_T)` of an exact number of
                        fire and time, but we usually care about drawing
                        <em>at least</em> that much, so we'll need to
                        add together all the possible combinations of at
                        least those target numbers.

                        <p>
                        `
                        P(k_F>=T_F, k_T>=T_T) =
                            sum_(i=T_F)^(K_F)
                            sum_(j=T_T)^(K_T)
                            P(i, j)
                        `

                        <p>
                        Now we're getting somewhere!  However, the above math
                        is still a simplified version of what the power
                        calculator <em>actually</em> does.  All the above
                        math assumes that individual cards provide one kind
                        of influence, but not more than one kind of influence,
                        or both power and influence.
                        As we know, in reality, cards can provide multiple
                        kinds of things:
                        perhaps power <em>and</em> time influence,
                        or power <em>and</em>
                        time influence <em>and</em> fire influence.

                        <p>
                        In order to account for this, the Power Calculator
                        first groups cards according to the sorts of
                        resources they produce.
                        After generating these groupings, it will enumerate
                        all possible combinations of those grouping which
                        &mdash; when combined &mdash; will generate enough
                        power and influence to satisfy
                        the target power and influence cost.  For each of
                        those enumerated combinations, it will compute the
                        probability of drawing that specific number of
                        sources from each group.  Finally, it will sum
                        those probability to find an overall probability
                        of satisfying the target cost.

                        <p>
                        As an example, consider the case
                        where we have a deck with three groups of
                        power/influence sources:  time sigils (<tt>1T</tt>),
                        fire sigils (<tt>1F</tt>), and additional power sources
                        which provide both fire and time (<tt>1FT</tt>).

                        Now, say we want to find the probability of being able
                        to play a card costing <tt>2FT</tt>.  We can sum up the
                        possible combination of grouped cards which will provide
                        enough power and influence to satisfy the overall cost:

                        <p>
                        `
                        P_(2FT) = {:
                            (P(k_(1FT) >= 2, k_(1T) >= 0, k_(1F) >= 0)),
                            (+),
                            (P(k_(1FT) = 1, k_(1T) >= 1, k_(1F) >= 0)),
                            (+),
                            (P(k_(1FT) = 1, k_(1T) = 0, k_(1F) >= 1)),
                            (+),
                            (P(k_(1FT) = 0, k_(1T) >= 1, k_(1F) >= 1))
                        :}
                        `

                        <p>
                        Thus, the calculator will compute
                        the probability for each specific combination
                        of grouped cards which happens to satisfy the
                        target cost, and then sum those probabilities
                        into an the overall probability value.
