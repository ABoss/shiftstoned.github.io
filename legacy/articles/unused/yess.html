        <pg><h1g><b>The New Icaria Black</b></h1g>Camat0’s <em>Removal Pile</em>,
          updated for the Fall of Argenport. How has the Power base changed and
          what makes it even better now?<br>
          <br>
          Shiftstoned: This is the deck you used as one of your four on Sunday,
          but the origins of it stretch back a while. <br>
          <br>
          This is the first deck I built with the Fall of Argenport. In fact I
          built this deck the day after Fall of Argenport was legal, and it has
          changed very little from there.<br>
          <br>
          But this version of FJS is basically an updated version of Removal
          Pile, the deck I made to break the Tavrod meta back in early 2018. At
          that time, manuS and I finished first and second in the Eternal
          Tournament Series S#W# with that version of the deck, the first
          tournament we ever played it.<br>
          <br>
          Shiftstoned: Since then, some things have changed in the way Power
          bases are built in Eternal. One of the major differences between this
          list and the previous versions appears to be the inclusion of all 12
          available Crests. How do you think this has improved the deck? Has it
          changed the way you play FJS control? <br>
          <br>
          camat0: Crests changed the game at a fundamental level. They not only
          made every Control and Midrange deck more consistent, but they also
          allow Control decks to play more Power without flooding out.<br>
          <br>
          Now that we have all the Crests, I think every Control deck that plays
          three factions should play at least one or two more Power cards than
          they did before. In the end I find more Power makes your deck work
          better in every way now. <br>
          <br>
          Also the existence of Crests makes it really hard to justify two
          faction Control decks any more. You want the Crest even if they are
          off-color, and at that point splashing another color is just too easy.<br>
          <br>
          Shiftstoned: It is also interesting to note that you added an extra
          copy of Privilege of Rank (a highly valuable discard target in
          addition to being a Power source), while at the same time removing
          Quarry (a powerful discard effect).<br>
          <br>
          camat0: People play Privilege of Rank only because it has synergy with
          Bulletshaper or other discard effects, when the truth is that the card
          is just good. I'm happy to hard cast the card in a lot of decks, but
          most people don't and I think that is why it was so
          underplayed.ollowing the subhead, the body of the article will appear
          here. Hopefully with some luck we will figure out the formatting
          problem where multiple indents occur.</pg><br>
